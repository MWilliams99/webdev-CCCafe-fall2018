# Web Development Cafe Website Fall 2018
## Project Description
Example Cafe business website created as my final project for the Fall 2018 CTI-110 Web, Programming, &amp; Database Foundations course at Halifax Community College.  
The assignment was to come up with a fictional business and to create a website for that business.  
This project uses HTML, CSS, and jQuery to demonstrate what was learned throughout the course. 

This project was completed on November 9th, 2018.

The cafe website includes four HTML pages:
- Index; This is the homepage for the website which introduces the user to the website and links to the other pages.
- Reviews; This page includes example reviews for the cafe and a form for the user to input their own review. This form validates if the user has input appropriate content but will not actually add a review.
- Events; This page includes example events held at the cafe including the dates and an image for each event.
- Menu; This is the menu page for the cafe website and demonstrates the usage of jQuery tabs to separate each part of the menu.
